# The pater Book

`pater` is a policy-aware plugin manager for Paternoster Rack marketplaces.

This documentation follows a Cargo-style split:
- **Guide** for workflows and rationale.
- **Reference** for precise behavior and constraints.
- **Commands** for CLI usage.
- **Operations** for CI and publishing.

For API-like internals generated from code comments, see rustdoc (`/api/` when hosted).
