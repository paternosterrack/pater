# Docs Maintenance

Rustdoc is the internal source of truth.

When behavior changes:
1. update matching rustdoc module docs,
2. update this mdBook section when workflow/reference meaning changes,
3. keep `docs/contracts/*` synchronized for schema-impacting changes,
4. add an entry in `CHANGELOG.md`.
