# Getting Started

New to `pater`? Start here.

This section is user-first and optimized for fast results:
- install `pater`,
- run a first real plugin workflow,
- verify your setup is healthy.

Local `../rack` examples are intentionally excluded from Getting Started.
See the maintainer workflow guide for local marketplace development.
